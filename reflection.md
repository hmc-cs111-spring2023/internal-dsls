# Reflection on implementing regular expressions of a DSL

## Which operators were easiest to implement and why?

## Which operators were most difficult to implement and why?

## Comment on the design of this internal DSL

Write a few brief paragraphs that discuss:

- What works about this design? (For example, what things seem easy and
  natural to say, using the DSL?)
- What doesn't work about this design? (For example, what things seem
  cumbersome to say?)
- Think of a syntactic change that might make the language better. How would
  you implement it _or_ what features of Scala would prevent you from
  implementing it? (You don't have to write code for this part. You could say
  "I would use extension to..." or "Scala's rules for valid
  identifiers prevent...")
